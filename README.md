# Blueprint - pifreak's version!

---
#### ***Balatro Seed Tools***

* Based on [The Soul](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/The-Soul/blob/main/immolate.js) from [MathIsFun0](https://github.com/MathIsFun0)
* Built with Vite And Mantine for a clean and visually cohesive experience. 
* Modified by pifreak-- and pifreak loves you!

## pifreak's experimentation:
* Added ability to create a "JAML Mapped"-View in Blueprint - pifreak's version!
* Added ability to search for seeds in your browser using WASM!
* Added ability to suffer immense pain, trying to use a UI created/modified by pifreak!
* Added ability to upload list of SEEDS in TXT or CSV format!

## pifreak's roadmap:
* Continue testing motely-wasm
* Continue unlocking performance using SharedArrayBuffer properly?
* No seriously why do I only get 8m/s for negleg? my pc get 35M/s per thread on that 💀
